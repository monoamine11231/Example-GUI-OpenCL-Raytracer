# Example OpenCL raytracer
Raytracer (**not a pathtracer**) made with pure C and OpenCL. Includes a single image renderer and an interactive GUI window with camera controls. A big thanks to [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb/) for allowing to render framebuffers on a canvas with camera controls.
